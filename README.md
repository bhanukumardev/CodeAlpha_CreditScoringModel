# CodeAlpha Credit Scoring Model

This repository contains my credit scoring model project for the Code Alpha Internship.

## Contents
- Jupyter Notebook (`CodeAlpha_CreditScoringModel.ipynb`)
- Data file (`german.data`)
- Trained model (`credit_scoring_rf_model.pkl`)
- Slides (`CodeAlpha_CreditScoringModel.slides.html`)

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
3. Run all cells to reproduce the results.

## Project Overview
- Built a machine learning model to predict credit risk using the UCI German Credit Data.
- Used Logistic Regression and Random Forest for classification.
- Evaluated with Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Analyzed feature importance for interpretability.

## Results
- Best model: Random Forest (add your ROC-AUC or accuracy here)
- Most important features: (list top features here)
